					<h3>What is reliability?</h3>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-12">
					<p>A product or process is considered to be reliable if it functions properly when expected. More
						specifically, in the field of engineering, reliability is often described in the following terms:</p>
					<p class="accent"><i>Reliability is the probability that a system will operate successfully for a specified
						period
						of time, under specified conditions, when used for the manner and purpose for which it was intended.</i></p>
					<p>Reliability engineering is a branch of engineering aimed at predicting, analyzing, and preventing or
						mitigating failures over time.</p>

					<h3>Why is reliability important?</h3>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-12">
					<p>Overall corporate success depends on the reliability of a company's products, processes, and services.
						Reliability is always a top customer concern and is increasingly vocalized by customers as a major factor in
						purchasing decisions. What is significant about reliability is that it is industry independent - no matter
						what an organization offers to the marketplace, reliability plays a key role in determining its success.</p>
					<p>Reliability plays a role in many aspects of business. A few examples of the impact of reliability on key
						corporate objectives are listed below:</p>
					<ul style="margin-left: 6%">
						<li><strong>Reputation.</strong> A company's reputation is very closely related to the reliability
							of its products. The more reliable a product is, the more likely the company is to have a favorable
							reputation.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Warranty costs.</strong> If a product fails to perform its function within the warranty
							period, its repair or replacement negatively affects profits. Additionally, if the failure is either large
							in magnitude or causes injuries or death, the company may become the focus of unwanted negative attention.
							Introducing reliability analyses in the early design stage is an important step in taking preventive
							actions, ultimately leading to a product that is more reliable.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Future business.</strong> A concentrated effort towards improved reliability shows
							existing customers that the manufacturer is serious about its product and committed to.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Customer satisfaction.</strong> This type of attitude has a positive impact on future
							business. Many companies publish their predicted or field measured reliability metrics to help gain an
							advantage over competitors who either do not publish their metrics or have poor reliability metrics.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Contract requirements.</strong> Many customers in today's market demand that their
							suppliers have an effective reliability program. These customers have learned the benefits of reliability
							analysis from experience.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Cost of ownership.</strong> Manufacturers may take reliability data and combine it with
							other cost information to illustrate the cost-effectiveness of their products. This life cycle cost
							analysis can prove that accenthough the initial cost of their product might be higher, the overall
							lifetime
							cost is lower than a competing product because their product requires fewer repairs or less maintenance.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Custom satisfaction.</strong> While a reliable product may not dramatically affect
							customer satisfaction in a positive manner, an unreliable product will severely affect customer
							satisfaction in a negative way. Thus, high reliability is ultimately a mandatory requirement for customer
							satisfaction.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Safety regulations.</strong> Manufacturers of highly critical devices must design their
							products to comply with current safety regulations. Failure to meet standards for protecting the heaccenth
							and safety of users and/or the general public can result in the breach of contract and even the loss of
							life.

					<h3>Common Reliability Measurements</h3>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-12">
					<p>Because reliability is such a crucial element to business success, analysis techniques and methods have
						been developed over time to help analyze and measure reliability to enable companies to improve areas of
						weakness. The field of reliability engineering is devoted to the development of tools and techniques to help
						companies reach their reliability goals.</p>
					<p>There are many metrics commonly used in reliability engineering to help assess reliability. Oftentimes,
						these metrics must be considered reference points. These metrics can help determine whether improvements
						have been made and if goals are being achieved. Additionally, metrics are important for establishing a
						baseline for reliability analysis.</p>
					<p>The following table describes some of the most common reliability measures that can be obtained from
						reliability analyses. While there are many more reliability measurements available, these parameters are
						widely used.</p>

					<h4>Reliability Measurement Table</h4>
					<div class="table-wrapper">
						<table class="alt">
							<thead>
							<tr>
								<th>Reliability Measure</th>
								<th>Description</th>
							</tr>
							</thead>
							<tbody>
							<tr>
								<td>Failure Rate</td>
								<td>
									The expected rate of occurrence of failure or the number of failures in a specified time period.
									Failure rate is typically expressed in failures per million or billion hours. For example, if your
									television has a failure rate of five failures per million hours, you can watch one million
									hour-long television shows and likely experience a failure during only five shows!
								</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)</td>
								<td>The number of hours to pass between failures. MTBF is typically expressed in hours. As an example,
									if the MTBF of your television is 1000 hours, you can on average watch it for 1000 hours before it
									will fail. This does not indicate that your television will fail exactly in the 1000th hour of
									watching, but that it will generally fail somewhere around 1000 hours of operation. For many systems
									(those which are defined as "constant failure rate systems"), MTBF is the inverse of the failure rate.
									This means that if the failure rate is two failures per million hours, the MTBF is equal to 1000000/2,
									or 500,000 hours.
								</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Mean Time to Failure (MTTF)</td>
								<td>The average time to failure for a system that is not repairable. For example, a satellite is
									typically not repairable. In such a case, the MTTF, or Mean Time to Failure, is used as the metric for
									measuring reliability. Once the failure occurs, the system cannot be replaced or repaired. This is
									different from a repairable system (television) described in the above example. If your television
									fails somewhere around the 1000th hour, you will get it repaired. It will then operate for about
									another 1000 hours (on average) or so before it needs to be repaired again.
								</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Reliability</td>
								<td>The probability that the item will perform a required function without failure under stated
									conditions for a stated period of time. Reliability is significant because it takes into account time.
									The measure of reliability answers the question: "How likely is it that my system will remain
									operational over a certain period of time?" Because reliability is expressed as probability, it is
									always a value between 0 and 1.
								</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Availability</td>
								<td>Availability, also a probability value, indicates the probability that a system is operating at a
									particular point in time. It answers the question: "How likely is it that my system is operating
									X hours out of a Y hour time frame?" Availability differs from reliability because it factors repairs
									into the measurement. To determine availability, the time to perform a repair must be known.
									Because availability is expressed as a probability, it is a value between 0 and 1.
								</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Mean Time to Repair (MTTR)</td>
								<td>The average time to return a failed item to an operable state. The MTTR, or Mean Time to Repair, is
									normally expressed in hours and indicates how long it takes to repair a system that is down due
									to a failure. Generally, MTTR does not include logistics time, such as the time required to receive a
									replacement part. MTTR indicates the actual time it takes to correct the problem.
								</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Unreliability</td>
								<td>Unreliabiity is the complement of reliability. If your reliability is 0.9, the unreliability is
									equal to 0.1 (1.0 - 0.9). It is a probability value, or a number between 0 and 1, that indicates
									the likelihood that a system cannot continuously operate up to a specified point in time.
								</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Unavailability</td>
								<td>Like unreliability, unavailability is the complement of availability. It is a probability value, or
									a number between 0 and 1, that indicates the likelihood that a system is not operatinal for a
									specified period of time.
								</td>

						Oftentimes, the reliability analyst may employ several tools depending on requirements. For example, if you
						were required to forecast the rate at which the system will fail, you would have to perform a reliability
						prediction. If you were also required to identify all of the possible events that could result in a system
						failure, you would have to perform a FMEA.
