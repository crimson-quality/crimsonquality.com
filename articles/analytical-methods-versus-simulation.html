                        A calculation method is analytical when results are computed using formulas derived from some
                        kind of mathematical analysis. For example, if 位 is the failure rate of a component, then the
                        reliability of the component for mission time t is R(t) = exp{-位t}. The numerical result for
                        R(t) can be obtained by computing exp{-位t} with the specified numerical values of 位 and t. In
                        general, analytical methods are quick and accurate. However, analytical methods are feasible
                        only if there are no complex dependencies.</p>
                    <p>
                        Simulation is when results are computed by mimicking the dynamic behavior of a system. In its
                        broader sense, simulation is the process of observing the dynamic behavior of a system with
                        varying sets of inputs. In reliability engineering, there is almost always randomness in the
                        system behavior. Thus, to mimic this behavior, simulation requires random numbers as inputs.
                        Simulation that involves random numbers is known as Monte Carlo simulation. Simulation is
                        preferred if analytical methods are infeasible or so complex that results are prone to numerical
                        round-off errors.</p>

                    <p>The formulas used in analytical methods to find numerical results are typically simple and
                        convenient, making it possible to find exact results. If a system is complex, the resulting
                        formulas may become complex, making the computational process lengthy and the results prone to
                        round-off errors. In such circumstances, results may not be exact.</p>
                    <p>In general, computing results using explicit closed-form expressions is inefficient for complex
                        systems because of long computation times and results that are prone to round-off errors. To
                        improve the computations, researchers have proposed several algorithms to compute results more
                        quickly and accurately. Windchill RBD uses such advanced algorithms whenever applicable. For
                        example, Windchill RBD computes results using one such advanced algorithm named the Pivotal
                        decomposition method whenever applicable.</p>
                    <p>It is difficult to find an exact analytical expression or algorithm for every scenario. It is
                        particularly difficult when complex dependencies exist. Such dependencies may include warm
                        standby components, shared repair resources, repair actions based on the state of the system,
                        imperfect maintenance actions, priorities in selecting the paths in a network, and general
                        failure/repair distributions.</p>
                    <p>To overcome the difficulties in analyzing systems with complex dependencies, a basic type of
                        simulation known as crude Monte Carlo simulation can be used to compute results. To increase the
                        efficiency, various improvements are proposed to the simulation process. They include variance
                        reduction techniques, such as importance sampling, and special types of simulation methods for
                        computing steady-state results. Relex RBD uses such types of advanced methods whenever
                        applicable.</p>
                    <p>Simulation is based on the statistical concept that when the number of trials of an experiment
                        approaches infinity, the average of the experiment
                        's outcome is equivalent to the expected value of the random variable under study. When
                        availability is computed, the outcome is either system success or failure. The average of this
                        outcome is the expected portion of success states, i.e., availability.</p>
                    <p>In reality, performing an infinite number of simulations is impossible. Therefore, an appropriate
                        number of iterations must be specified. Determining the number of simulation iterations that
                        will produce results conforming to the required accuracy within a reasonable computational time
                        is important. This value varies, depending on several parameters.</p>

                    <p>Distribution information for failure and repair times is provided in the above figure. The
                        default value for the number of iterations is 1000, and the random number seed is 1. Using these
                        values, the availability result is 0.731. Is this the true value for availability? To answer
                        this question, use a seed of 2 to evaluate availability again. The availability result is 0.726,
                        which is a difference of 0.005. The answer varies with the seed because the sequence of random
                        numbers used in the simulation process is different. So, what is the true value of availability?
                        As mentioned previously, simulation produces accurate results only when the number of iterations
                        is large. When this is the case, the result does not depend on the seed because all possible
                        sequences of random numbers produce the same availability value.</p>
                    <p>If the number of iterations is 10,000,000 rather than the default of 1000, the result for
                        availability is 0.735914 with a random seed of 1. If we use a seed of 2 and compute availability
                        again, the result is 0.736025. The difference in results is 0.000111, which is much less than
                        0.005. In general, the difference decreases as the number of iterations increases. (It should be
                        noted that increasing the number of iterations increases the computational time.)</p>
                    <p>The effects of randomness on the results can be measured with the variance of the simulation
                        output and the confidence intervals on the availability results. The confidence intervals are
                        the range of availability values, bounded above and below, within which the true availability
                        value is expected to fall with a certain percentage of confidence. The width of the confidence
                        intervals is directly proportional to the standard deviation (square root of variance). The
                        standard deviation is inversely proportional to the square root of the number of simulations.
                        Therefore, increasing the number of simulation iterations by 4 times generally reduces the
                        standard deviation to approximately 50%. Hence, the width of the confidence intervals is reduced
                        to 50%. Reducing the standard deviation also decreases the width of the confidence intervals.
                        Therefore, the number of iterations can be adjusted so that the confidence intervals are within
                        the required accuracy.</p>

                    <p>Assume that you want to find the availability of the single component system above within 卤1%
                        accuracy with a 95% confidence. First, compute the availability and 95% confidence intervals
                        with 1000 iterations. The results are:</p>
                    <ul style="margin-left: 6%">
                        <li>Availability = 0.731</li>
                        <li>Availability LCI = 0.70351</li>
                        <li>Availability UCI = 0.75849</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The width of the confidence interval for availability is UCI - LCI (0.05498). The width is 7.5%
                        of the availability (0.731). If the true value falls somewhere within this interval, then the
                        maximum possible error is 卤3.75% of the availability.</p>
                    <p>The true value falls within these bounds with the 95 percent confidence. Therefore, the maximum
                        possible error in the availability results is 卤3.75% with 95% confidence. It is 3.75 times the
                        required accuracy of 卤1%. To reduce the width of the intervals 3.75 times, you must increase the
                        number of simulations to (3.75)^2 or approximately 14 times. Thus, compute the results with
                        14,000 simulations. The results are:</p>
                    <ul style="margin-left: 6%">
                        <li>Availability = 0.7355</li>
                        <li>Availability LCI = 0.728192</li>
                        <li>Availability UCI = 0.742808</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The width of the interval is 0.014616. It is 1.98% of the availability estimate. Therefore, the
                        maximum possible error is 卤0.99% with 95% confidence. This procedure provides a quick way to
                        determine the number of simulation iterations.</p>

                    <p>Simulation can be used for analyzing any system. However, the accuracy of the results depends on
                        the number of iterations and the complexity of the system. To achieve the desired level of
                        accuracy, the number of simulations can be determined as indicated above. Analytical methods

                        analytical results are not possible or prone to round-off errors, then simulation should be
