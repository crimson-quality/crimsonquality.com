                    <h2>Creating an Effective FRACAS for Any Application</h2>
                    <p>A FRACAS (Failure Reporting, Analysis, and Correction Action System) is an important process by
                        which the quality and reliability of a product, service, process, or software application can be
                        tracked, measured, and ultimately improved. Companies known for providing highly reliable
                        products have identified a comprehensive closed-loop FRACAS as one of the most critical elements
                        in their reliability programs. The following table was published by the Defense Systems
                        Information Analysis Center (Formerly known as the Reliability Information Analysis Center,

                <p>As you can see, 88.3 percent of the survey respondents viewed a FRACAS as the most important
                    reliability task. It received the highest rating because of its ability to feed root failure cause
                    and corrective action information back into the design process to further improve design
                    reliability. And, RAC points out, early elimination of root failure causes greatly contributes to
                    both product reliability growth and attaining customer satisfaction following product/service
                    delivery.</p>

                            The Failure Reporting, Analysis and Corrective Action System (FRACAS) Application Guidelines
                            provides
                            information about what a FRACAS is, how it can be effectively tailored, and how it can be
                            applied beyond
                            the traditional tracking of hardware failures. To perform a qualitative assessment, such as
                            whether a
                            customer is satisfied with
                            a product or service, or a quantitative assessment, such as whether the reliability
                            performance goals of
                            a product or service have been achieved, a FRACAS must be used consistently. According to
                            this
                            publication, defining what constitutes a failure is perhaps the most critical aspect of
                            implementing an
                            effective FRACAS. The following table provides RAC definitions for a failure and failure

                            remedy a situation promptly makes it possible to avoid additional costs, schedule delays,
                            safety-related events, and declining customer satisfaction due to recurrences. The necessity
                            for accessing up-to-date incident information in an organized manner easily justifies the
                            use of dedicated software capable of meeting these demands.</p>
