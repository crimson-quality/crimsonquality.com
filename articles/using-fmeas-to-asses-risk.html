                        (Failure Mode and Effects Analyses/Failure Mode, Effects, and Criticality Analyses)
                        represent one of the most commonly used tools in reliability assessment programs. In a survey
                        published by the Reliability Analysis Center (RAC), 70% of respondents identified FMECA as one
                        of the most important reliability tasks in use for reliability programs. Due to their flexible
                        yet organized approach, it is easy to see why FMEAs are a tool of choice for many reliability
                        professionals.</p>

                <div class="col-12">
                    <p>Because FMEAs can be approached and organized in a multitude of formats, they can easily be
                        adapted to customer needs. Enabling the analyst to evaluate at a high level or at a very
                        detailed level, FMEAs provide a valuable way to assess risk and to plan and organize an
                        effective approach to address reliability issues. Additionally, FMEAs can be applied to a wide
                        range of industries because they can be used to evaluate hardware systems, process control
                        systems, and even human tasks in a Human Factors Process FMEA.</p>

                <div class="col-12">
                    <p>The basic components of a FMEA consist of some type of hierarchical breakdown, an outlining of
                        all possible Failure Modes of all elements, and then a determination of the Effects of these
                        failure modes. The power in FMEAs is realized when this analysis is extended to include
                        information relating to the risk of these potential system failures. The idea is to be able to
                        use a FMEA to assess which failure modes require effort to prevent, mitigate, detect, or ignore.
                        This assessment of criticality in a FMEA lays the groundwork for an organized approach to risk
                        management. By using FMEAs to assign and categorize failure modes, the resulting categories can
                        each have a defined plan of action. For example, high risk items must be flagged, and a plan to
                        eliminate or mitigate them formulated and deployed. Medium level items may require some type of
                        detection mechanism to be designed. Low risk items perhaps require no action.</p>

                    <p>The issue then becomes how to adequately assess the risk levels of failure modes. There are some
                        industry-adopted approaches to quantifying risk in FMEAs, as well as a number of user-defined
                        approaches. Well-designed commercially available FMEA software will support any of these
                        approaches to risk assessment. Four main approaches will be discussed here:</p>

                <div class="col-12">
                    <p>Mode criticality is one of the more quantified methods used to analyze criticality. Mode
                        criticality is a numerical value that can be calculated and applied to each failure mode. Mode
                        criticalities are based on a FMECA approach defined in MIL-STD-1629, a commonly used FMECA
                        methodology. Applied more easily in a hardware environment, mode criticalities are based on
                        actual failure rate values. For example, if the failure rate of a component of the system is
                        established in some manner, the analyst then assigns a mode percentage to each possible failure
                        mode of the component. For example, if a component has two failure modes, perhaps one occurs 75%
                        of the time, and the other occurs 25% of the time. (There are databases available to automate
                        this task. They offer lists of failure modes for components and their associated mode
                        percentages.)</p>

                    <p>Using this information, a mode failure rate can be calculated by multiplying the failure rate by
                        the mode percentage. The analyst must also assess the failure effect probability, or the
                        probability that the given failure effect is likely to occur. The equation for mode criticality
                        is given by:</p>

                        Numbers or RPNs are also numerical assessments of risk. RPNs are based on a FMEA
                        approach adopted in FMEA methodologies such as those defined by SAE, AIAG, and Ford. RPN values
                        range from 1 to 1000. To use RPNs, the analyst evaluates each failure mode and determines the
                        Severity, Occurrence, and Detection level in each case. All three of these parameters are based
                        on a 1-10 scale. A score of 10 indicates the most severe, most likely to occur, and least likely
                        to be detected failure mode. The calculation of RPN is then defined as:</p>

                <div class="col-12">
                    <p>Because RPNs fall into a well-defined 1-1000 scale, analysts often break RPN values into various
                        range levels. Items within the high risk range can then be addressed. Sometimes, a report of RPN
                        values in a Pareto, color-coded format is useful.</p>

                        level assessment technique is introduced in the book FMEA - Failure Modes &
                        Effect Analysis - Predicting & Preventing Problems Before They Occur by Paul Palady. This
                        approach allows the analyst to group failure modes into established categories to ensure that
                        the most critical items are evaluated. A graphical representation is used, where the x axis is a
                        specified risk value such as severity. The y axis is a secondary risk factor such as occurrence.
                        The graph is broken into three distinct areas by lines that intersect both axes. By then
                        graphing each failure mode, they will fall into one of the three graph areas: high, medium, or
                        low.</p>

                        Each technique has advantages, and a combination of approaches may be used as well. All methods
                        feature a way to allow the FMEA analyst to gather failure mode information to ensure that the
                        most significant failure modes are addressed. By using the organized framework of a FMEA to
                        perform this assessment, you can have confidence that risk areas have been evaluated and
                        quantified.</p>
