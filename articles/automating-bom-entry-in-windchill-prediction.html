						<p>One of the major time saving features of the Windchill Prediction tool is the built in Import Wizard.
							Instead of having to manually enter each part into the tool, Windchill Prediction can import a Bill of
							Materials (BOM) from common file formats such as Excel, Access, SML or Text File. This feature creates a
							simple step by step process that walks through the data importing process. If the BOMs are always created
							in
							the same format, once the first import has been mapped out, the settings can be saved to an Import/Export
							Template. This allows the user to select the template during future import processes, and saves the time
							required to map out data fields.</p>

						<h4>Reliability Measurement Table</h4>
						<div class="table-wrapper">
							<table class="alt">
								<thead>
									<tr>
										<th>Reliability Measure</th>
										<th>Description</th>
									</tr>
								</thead>
								<tbody>
									<tr>
										<td>Failure Rate</td>
										<td>
											The expected rate of occurrence of failure or the number of failures in a specified time period.
											Failure rate is typically expressed in failures per million or billion hours. For example, if your
											television has a failure rate of five failures per million hours, you can watch one million
											hour-long television shows and likely experience a failure during only five shows!
										</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td>Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)</td>
										<td>The number of hours to pass between failures. MTBF is typically expressed in hours. As an
											example,
											if the MTBF of your television is 1000 hours, you can on average watch it for 1000 hours before it
											will fail. This does not indicate that your television will fail exactly in the 1000th hour of
											watching, but that it will generally fail somewhere around 1000 hours of operation. For many
											systems
											(those which are defined as "constant failure rate systems"), MTBF is the inverse of the failure
											rate.
											This means that if the failure rate is two failures per million hours, the MTBF is equal to
											1000000/2,
											or 500,000 hours.
										</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td>Mean Time to Failure (MTTF)</td>
										<td>The average time to failure for a system that is not repairable. For example, a satellite is
											typically not repairable. In such a case, the MTTF, or Mean Time to Failure, is used as the metric
											for
											measuring reliability. Once the failure occurs, the system cannot be replaced or repaired. This is
											different from a repairable system (television) described in the above example. If your television
											fails somewhere around the 1000th hour, you will get it repaired. It will then operate for about
											another 1000 hours (on average) or so before it needs to be repaired again.
										</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td>Reliability</td>
										<td>The probability that the item will perform a required function without failure under stated
											conditions for a stated period of time. Reliability is significant because it takes into account
											time.
											The measure of reliability answers the question: "How likely is it that my system will remain
											operational over a certain period of time?" Because reliability is expressed as probability, it is
											always a value between 0 and 1.
										</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td>Availability</td>
										<td>Availability, also a probability value, indicates the probability that a system is operating at
											a
											particular point in time. It answers the question: "How likely is it that my system is operating
											X hours out of a Y hour time frame?" Availability differs from reliability because it factors
											repairs
											into the measurement. To determine availability, the time to perform a repair must be known.
											Because availability is expressed as a probability, it is a value between 0 and 1.
										</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td>Mean Time to Repair (MTTR)</td>
										<td>The average time to return a failed item to an operable state. The MTTR, or Mean Time to Repair,
											is
											normally expressed in hours and indicates how long it takes to repair a system that is down due
											to a failure. Generally, MTTR does not include logistics time, such as the time required to
											receive a
											replacement part. MTTR indicates the actual time it takes to correct the problem.
										</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td>Unreliability</td>
										<td>Unreliabiity is the complement of reliability. If your reliability is 0.9, the unreliability is
											equal to 0.1 (1.0 - 0.9). It is a probability value, or a number between 0 and 1, that indicates
											the likelihood that a system cannot continuously operate up to a specified point in time.
										</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td>Unavailability</td>
										<td>Like unreliability, unavailability is the complement of availability. It is a probability value,
											or
											a number between 0 and 1, that indicates the likelihood that a system is not operatinal for a
											specified period of time.
										</td>

							Oftentimes, the reliability analyst may employ several tools depending on requirements. For example, if
							you
							were required to forecast the rate at which the system will fail, you would have to perform a reliability
							prediction. If you were also required to identify all of the possible events that could result in a system
							failure, you would have to perform a FMEA.
