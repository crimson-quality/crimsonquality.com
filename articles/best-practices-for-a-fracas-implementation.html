                    <h2>Eight Steps to a Successful FRACAS Implementation</h2>
                    <p><span class="image right"><img src="../images/cache_888940834.jpg" alt=""></span>The need to
                        efficiently track, analyze, and correct problems found during product development,
                        testing, and operation spans all industries and classifications, including hardware, software,
                        process management, and services in both government and commercial sectors. While general
                        guidelines exist for implementing a Failure Reporting, Analysis, and Corrective Action System
                        (FRACAS), these guidelines fail to address the organizational issues that pose a risk to the
                        ultimate success of the FRACAS.</p>
                    <p>Three main issues usually surface when FRACAS implementations are being deployed:</p>
                    <ol style="margin-left: 6%">
                        <li>Complex organization interaction</li>
                        <li>Lack of prioritized goals</li>
                        <li>Inefficient and ineffective data tracking</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Each of these issues affects the FRACAS process in several ways.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-12">
                    <h3>Issue 1: Complex organization interaction</h3>
                    <p>Because a dozen or more groups may be involved in contributing data to or using the data
                        collected in
                        a FRACAS, the process can become quite complex, especially when many of these groups may need to
                        be
                        involved in the process at multiple points. As the complexity of the process increases, the time
                        between opening and closing an incident also increases. If the process becomes too complex,
                        issues
                        can be "lost" or never thoroughly addressed. This not only compromises the analysis of trends,
                        but
                        can also result in the eventual breakdown of the process.</p>
                    <h3>Issue 2: Lack of Prioritized Goals</h3>
                    <p>While there are many reasons for implementing a FRACAS, three common ones are:</p>
                    <ol style="margin-left: 6%">
                        <li>Compliance with customer requirements and standards</li>
                        <li>Gaining insights into the reliability of products</li>
                        <li>Improving the next generation of product designs</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Oftentimes, the upfront planning and funding necessary for a proper FRACAS implementation do not
                        occur, leaving companies scrambling for resources late in the product development cycle. To
                        remedy this situation, many companies make use of a general purpose tool already available to
                        them, such as Microsoft Excel or Microsoft Access, with the intent that this temporary solution
                        will be replaced by a full-featured FRACAS as soon as resources are available.</p>
                    <p>Unless this occurs relatively quickly, a minimal FRACAS becomes the standard, resulting in poor
                        efficiency, insufficient information, and a lack of cohesiveness. While the customer requirement
                        for a FRACAS may be satisfied by this "temporary" solution, gaining insights into product
                        reliability or improving the next generation of product designs becomes virtually impossible to
                        achieve. To gain such insights or design improvements, all functional groups who are to use the
                        FRACAS must collectively identify and prioritize the specific goals that they have for the
                        system and then determine the system outputs necessary to assess whether these goals are being
                        met.</p>
                    <h3>Issue 3: Ineffective and Inefficient Data Tracking</h3>
                    <p><span class="image right"><img src="../images/cache_888941444.jpg" alt=""></span>Gathering the
                        right data and not all available data is an important aspect of any FRACAS. When data entry
                        takes too long or is too cumbersome, analysts are likely to skip fields when logging problems or
                        even fail to enter less critical problems at all! Often, information gathering is not
                        standardized, which makes the analysis of the data a time-consuming, manual process. When data
                        collection is not organized or is inconsistent, the usefulness of the data decreases
                        considerably.</p>

                    <h2>Eight Steps to a Successful FRACAS Implementation</h2>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-12">
                    <p>The following eight-step method has been developed to address the organizational issues described
                        above. Performing these eight steps enables you to deliver a high-performance FRACAS. This
                        methodology, has been effectively used in several scenarios. It can easily be modified to fit
                        any situation.</p>
                    <h3>Step 1: Define the Goals and Success Factors</h3>
                    <p>The foundation for a successful FRACAS implementation rests on how well the primary goals are
                        defined. To this end, each functional group must identify the specific goals that they have for
                        the FRACAS. Typical goals include lowering maintenance costs, improving overall reliability, and
                        improving next generation product design. Once each group has set goals, one representative from
                        each group and an executive or management representative must meet to review, consolidate, and
                        prioritize these goals.</p>
                    <p>During this meeting, a realistic and quantifiable success factor should be attached to all
                        mutually agreed upon goals. For example, if a goal is to lower maintenance costs, a quantifiable
                        success factor may be to reduce these costs by 10% over the next 12 months. Once attendees sign
                        off on goals and success factors, the FRACAS "owner" should communicate them back to the members
                        of all groups.</p>
                    <h3>Step 2. Define the Output</h3>
                    <p><span class="image right"><img src="../images/cache_889100823.png" alt=""></span>Based on these
                        goals, each team must define the outputs that they require from the system to
                        assess whether or not the success factors assigned to them are achieved. Typically, output is
                        defined in terms of calculations, charts, graphs, and reports. To ensure that the number of
                        outputs requested remains manageable, each output should be mapped to a goal and success
                        factor.</p>
                    <h3>Step 3. Map the Process/Workflow</h3>
                    <p>Through a series of meetings and interviews with users, determine the workflow that each group
                        expects to follow and then develop a consolidated process diagram that best simplifies the
                        entire FRACAS process so that needed outputs can be generated in a timely manner. Because too
                        many steps can negatively affect the process, work to ensure that workflow steps are minimized
                        so that the process is not too complex.</p>
                    <h3>Step 4. Map Data Required and Input Method</h3>
                    <p>Using output requirements and the consolidated process diagram, determine the minimum number of
                        data fields to support each step of the workflow process. The goal is to determine what data is
                        important, eliminating the collection of data that has no purpose. Once data fields are
                        established, determine how they will be populated as well as where users will see them.
                        Population methods include pre-population based on previous user input, selection from choice
                        lists, direct data entry, and even bar code entry. Also make sure to establish rules for data
                        entry, including what information is required and how it is to be kept clean and consistent.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-12">
                    <h3>Step 5. Implement a Prototype FRACAS</h3>
                    <p>There are three levels of tools for supporting a FRACAS:<span class="image right"><img
                            src="../images/cache_889100883.png" alt=""></span></p>
                    <ol style="margin-left: 6%">
                        <li>General purpose tools</li>
                        <li>Workgroup applications that provide full-feature FRACAS support to small groups of users
                        </li>
                        <li>Enterprise applications that provide full-feature FRACAS support for large amounts of data
                            and many users
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <h3>Step 6: Accept Feedback and Modify FRACAS</h3>
                    <p>After the FRACAS prototype is ready, have users put it through its paces, determining whether its
                        outputs will indicate if goals and success factors are met. You are likely to find areas that
                        need additional work. This is the time to accept constructive feedback and make the
                        modifications necessary. Prior to proceeding to system rollout, have the group representatives
                        and the executive or management representative sign off on the system to demonstrate their
                        approval and continued support.</p>
                    <h3>Step 7. Rollout and Train</h3>
                    <p>Determine if the system will be rolled out to all users at once or whether a phased approach will
                        be used. Providing that you have the time, a phased approach is much preferred. As the various
                        groups of users are trained and brought online, the issues that they uncover can be better
                        addressed. Additionally, the implementation and training teams are able to refine their efforts
                        to provide better support for later groups.</p>
                    <h3>Step 8. Continue to Change</h3>
                    <p>Based on user feedback, continual change to your FRACAS can and should be expected. As business
                        objectives and processes change, your FRACAS needs to evolve to support these changes.
                        Throughout this process, it is important to validate all changes to ensure that they are
                        consistent with the overall goals that were initially established. This will ensure a
                        high-performance and functional FRACAS for many years to come.</p>
