                        When calculating RBDs (Reliability Block Diagrams) in Windchill RBD, four different availability
                        values can be computed: Availability, Mean Availability, Steady-State Availability, and
                        Operational Availability. What are the differences between these different values and when
                        should I select one over the other?</p>

                    <p>Availability is one of the most important reliability measures of repairable systems because it
                        takes into account both failure and repair information. Availability is defined as the
                        probability that an item (system, subsystem, or component) is available for operation at a
                        specified time given that is used under stated conditions in an ideal support environment. For
                        simplification, the stated conditions are generally omitted from the definition.</p>
                    <p>If a system operates when in a good condition, availability can be defined as the probability
                        that the system is in operation at a specified time. Availability can also be defined as:</p>
                    <p style="text-align: center"><strong>A(t) = Availability = Probability {system is in good
                        condition}</strong></p>
                    <p>The availability at time t is the expected number of times the system is in good condition at
                        time t. While the terms ability, capability, and degree are sometimes used in place of the term
                        probability, these other terms are generally measured using probability. Thus, it is best to
                        define availability in terms of probability.</p>
                    <p>Similarly, the terms at any time, at an unknown time, or at a random time are sometimes used in
                        place of the term at a specified time. For non-repairable (non-maintainable) systems, these
                        terms are rarely useful and often confusing. For non-repairable systems, it is best to use at a
                        specified time in the definition of availability.</p>
                    <p>For repairable (maintainable) systems, which consist of components that can be repaired or
                        replaced, the estimate of system availability can become constant with respect to time as time
                        progresses. This condition is known as the steady-state condition. Under such conditions, time
                        need not be explicitly specified for availability to be calculated. Thus, using the terms at any
                        time, at an unknown time, or at a random time in the definition for availability is valid for
                        steady-state conditions.</p>

                    <p>The availability of the system depends on its initial condition and both the failure and repair
                        distributions specified for modeling its failure and repair processes. It is a common practice
                        to assume that the system is initially in good condition and that the system is as good as new
                        (meaning that the effective age of the system is zero). For a single-unit system with
                        exponential failure and repair distributions having λ and μ as its respective rates,
                        availability is:</p>
                    <div class="col-12 align-center">
                        <span class="image"><img src="../images/cache_888733296.png" alt=""</span>
                    </div>
                    <p>Because this availability value is a function of time t, it is called time-specific availability
                        or time-dependent availability. In stochastic process terminology, it is called transient
                        availability. On occasion, it is also called instantaneous availability or point availability
                        because it is evaluated at a particular instance or point in time. In Windchill RBD, selecting
                        the Availability option causes time-specific availability to be calculated. Knowing the system
                        availability at specified points in time is especially helpful and important for systems with
                        shorter durations.</p>

                    <p>Mean availability is the expected percentage of uptime within a time interval. It is also called
                        average availability or interval availability. The cost of system downtime is directly related
                        to its mean availability. For systems with calendar time-based periodic maintenance policies,
                        availability may be zero at regular periodic intervals. In such cases, mean availability is a
                        more meaningful measure than availability.</p>

                    <p>Steady-state availability is calculated when time tends to infinity where the change in A(t) with
                        respect to time becomes negligible (converges to zero). Because the availability result
                        converges to an asymptotic value, steady-state availability is sometimes called asymptotic
                        availability. Since an asymptotic condition occurs only when t is large (theoretically
                        infinity), steady-state availability is also called long-run availability. Steady-state
                        availability is the mean uptime (MUT) divided by the sum of the mean uptime (MUT) and mean
                        downtime (MDT):</p>
                    <p style="text-align: center"><strong>
                        A(∞)= μ / (λ + μ) = MUT / (MUT + MDT)</strong></p>
                    <p>Although a system theoretically reaches a steady state only at infinite time, it has been proven
                        that the actual change in availability is negligible after reaching a certain time. Because most
                        systems are designed for longer durations, the lengths of which are not precisely known upon
                        initial start-ups, the estimate of availability reaches a steady-state value within a reasonable
                        time. Thus, steady-state availability results are critical to analyzing the long-run behavior of
                        the system.</p>
                    <p>An advantage of steady-state results is that they can be computed quickly and accurately. Under
                        steady-state conditions, mean availability is equivalent to availability. Therefore,
                        steady-state availability can also be used for steady-state mean availability.

                    <p>Corrective repair of a component or system may not start immediately due to logistics and
                        administrative delays. Such delays are generally grouped and classified as logistic delay times.
                        In such cases, the mean downtime is the sum of the mean corrective/repair time (MCT) and the
                        mean logistic delay time (MLDT). The availability value that considers the effects of logistic
                        delay times is known as operational availability. The equation generally provided in reliability
                        textbooks is for steady-state operational availability. This equation is:</p>
                    <p style="text-align: center"><strong>
                        Ao = MUT/ (MUT + MCT + MLDT)</strong></p>
                    <p>However, logistic delay times are also applicable for shorter durations. This is why Windchill
                        RBD allows you to choose between calculating time-specific operational availability and
                        steady-state operational availability. Whenever you select the option for calculating
                        operational availability, Relex calculates time-specific operational availability. Because
                        Windchill RBD will also then consider logistic delay times in the calculation of the
                        steady-state availability, the resulting value for it is the steady-state operational
                        availability. Similarly, the resulting value for the mean availability is the mean operational
                        availability.</p>
                    <p>If operational availability is the "real" availability of the system, why calculate an
                        availability value that does not consider logistic delay times? Logistic delay times for a
                        specific component may depend on the location where it is used, the type of logistic facilities
                        available, and the effectiveness of the maintenance management. Because logistic delays can be
                        minimized or eliminated, the difference between availability and the operational availability is
                        a measure of loss in availability due to logistic delays. Therefore, an availability value that
                        does not consider these delays is the inherent property of the system. This is why such an
                        availability value is also known as inherent availability or intrinsic availability.
