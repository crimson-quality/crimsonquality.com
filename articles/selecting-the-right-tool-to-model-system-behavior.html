                    <h2>The Short Answer</h2>
                    <p>Most reliability problems involve some kind of randomness. A system that has a random nature
                        follows a stochastic process. Both RBDs and fault trees are high-level modeling tools that
                        graphically represent the system success/failure logic of a system subject to a stochastic
                        process. The graphical nature of these tools allows system failure and repair behaviors to be
                        specified easily. Therefore, whenever possible, it is recommended that these high-level tools be
                        used. When complex dependencies exist among various parts of the system, using a low-level
                        Markov tool may be necessary. While specifying system behavior in a Markov tool is
                        time-consuming and skill-intensive, the power and flexibility it offers is unsurpassed.</p>

                    <h2>The Details</h2>
                    <p>Reliability engineering deals with the failure and repair behaviors of systems and their
                        components. In general, failure and repair times involve randomness. Therefore, predicting exact
                        failure and repair times in advance is impossible. However, the random nature of these times can
                        be represented using statistical distributions. Thus, failure and repair behaviors follow
                        stochastic processes. Such systems are known as stochastic systems.</p>
                    <p>A Markov process is a special kind of stochastic process. In a Markov process, the future
                        behavior of the system depends on only the current state of the system. The history of prior
                        events is irrelevant. Systems that follow a Markov process are known as Markovian systems. A
                        Markov chain is a special type of Markov process where the system has discrete state-space.
                        RBDs, fault trees, and Markov chains are all used to represent Markovian systems.</p>
                    <p>Reliability engineering deals with two kinds of problems associated with stochastic
                        processes:</p>
                    <ul style="margin-left: 6%">
                        <li>
                            Finding the stochastic behavior of individual components. The goal here is to determine
                            underlying failure and repair distributions and their parameters. Reliability prediction and
                            failure data (Weibull) analysis are used for this purpose.
                        </li>
                        <li>Determining the reliability (failure/repair) characteristics of the system using the
                            reliability characteristics of the components and the given system failure logic. Fault
                            trees, RBDs, and Markov chains are used for this purpose.
                        </li>

                    <h2>High Level Tools</h2>
                    <p>In high-level modeling tools, system success/failure logic can be specified graphically as a
                        combination of component or event successes/failures. RBDs and fault trees are considered
                        high-level tools because they provide easy system behavior specification and accurate results.
                        In general, RBDs represent system success logic, and fault trees represent system failure logic.
                        The behavior of each component or event is specified independently.</p>
                    <p>Introduced during World War II, RBDs made it easy to specify and understand system success in
                        terms of component successes. By the 1960s, highly developed RBDs were being used extensively to
                        attain safety and reliability goals. However, causes for system failure are not always a result
                        of component failure.</p>
                    <p>In 1961, W. A. Watson of Bell Telephone Laboratories developed a plan to evaluate the safety of
                        the Minuteman Launch Control System. This plan was the forerunner of what is now known as Fault
                        Tree analysis. It is used to model system failures caused by component failures and/or external
                        events, environmental influences, human errors, and operational and maintenance errors. Today,
                        highly developed fault trees are used to model systems that can fail in several modes and may
                        experience several kinds of unsafe situations. They are also used to model operational systems
                        that experience unsafe situations.</p>
                    <p>In most cases, a fault tree can be converted to an RBD, and an RBD can be converted to a fault
                        tree. If, however, a fault tree contains events other than component failures, converting it to
                        an RBD is generally illogical. If a fault tree contains common cause failures or disjoint
                        events, converting it to an RBD is likely to be infeasible.</p>

                    <h2>Low Level Tools</h2>
                    <p>In low-level modeling tools, all system behaviors are explicitly specified by the analyst. Markov
                        chains were proposed in the early 1900s by Andrei A. Markov, whose work launched the theory of
                        stochastic processes. State transition diagrams provide a low-level method for specifying Markov
                        chains. In 1923, Norbert Wiener proposed a continuous Markov process. During the 1930s, Andrei
                        Kolmogorov provided the foundation of the general theory.</p>
                    <p>The benefits of low-level Markov tools include power and flexibility. When complex dependencies
                        exist among various parts of the system, failure and repair behaviors may only be able to be
                        represented using a Markov tool. For example, it may be necessary to use a Markov tool to model
                        combinations of the following scenarios:</p>
                    <ul style="margin-left: 6%">
                        <li>Standby failures</li>
                        <li>Non-standard common cause failures</li>
                        <li>Induced failures and shared load systems</li>
                        <li>Imperfect fault coverage and switchover mechanisms</li>
                        <li>Priorities in repairs</li>
                        <li>Limited repair resources</li>
                        <li>Failure sequence-dependent consequences.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Although very powerful and flexible, Markov tools require advanced modeling skills to use. For
                        large systems, the system specification process is time-consuming and prone to human error.
                        Therefore, if a system can be represented using a high-level modeling tool, its use is generally
                        recommended.</p>

                    <h2>High-Level Tools are Evolutionary</h2>
                    <p>High-level tools have been enhanced over time so that they can model common scenarios that occur
                        in reliability engineering. For example, the recent introduction of dynamics gates to fault
                        trees allows them to model several sequence dependent behaviors. Similarly, the addition of
                        SPARE gates provide for modeling cold or warm standby components. Such enhancements to fault
                        trees have made the use of Markov tools unnecessary for these situations. Similarly, the
                        addition of switch failures, standby blocks, and junctions to RBDs allows them to model
                        situations that could once be handled only by Markov tools.</p>
                    <p>The enhancement of high-level modeling tools continues to be an evolutionary process. As the need
                        to model a particular scenario becomes more common, additional capabilities are often
                        incorporated. For example, Windchill RBD (formerly Relex RBD) supports common spares pools, load
                        sharing, imperfect maintenances, and limited repair resources. However, including capabilities
                        for modeling all types of scenarios in a high-level modeling tool will never be possible because
                        the tool would become too complex, causing solution quality to decrease. Thus, the need for
                        low-level Markov tools will remain.</p>

                    <ul style="margin-left: 6%">
                        <li>If all components are in series and failure and repair distributions are exponential, then
                            use system-level calculations from a reliability prediction tool.
                        </li>
                        <li>If all components are independent, then use RBDs, regardless of the failure and repair
                            distributions.
                        </li>
                        <li>If abnormal events in the system can be caused by various non-component failure events and
                            the kind of dependencies in the system can be supported with the features available in your
                            fault tree tool (disjoint events, common cause failures, dynamic gates, etc.), then use
                            fault trees.
                        </li>
                        <li>If failure and repair distributions are exponential (may vary with the system state) and
                            several dependencies exist among the components, then use Markov diagrams.
                        </li>
                        <li>If several combinations of the above conditions exist, then use a combination of tools.</li>

                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>High-level modeling tools avoid the explicit system specification required by low-level Markov
                        tools. However, it is impossible to find a high-level tool that conveniently represents all
                        kinds of stochastic processes. To choose the right modeling tool, you need to be aware of the
                        tool's current features and limitations. For some reliability problems, it may be beneficial to
                        use RBDs for various portions, and fault trees and Markov diagrams for other portions. In such
                        cases, the use of diagram linking to create hybrid models is highly desirable.</p>
