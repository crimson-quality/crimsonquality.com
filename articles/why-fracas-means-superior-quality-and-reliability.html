                        engineering, FRACAS is an acronym for Failure Reporting, Analysis, and Corrective
                        Action System. FRACAS is the term used to designate a process by which companies track product
                        defects and effectively respond and make corrections to fix problems. Product defects may be
                        tracked during product design, testing, manufacturing, and field deployment. A comprehensive
                        FRACAS allows you to efficiently track issues and ensure that reliability problems are addressed
                        in a timely and successful manner. The FRACAS process is used throughout all types of
                        industries. Successful FRACAS programs provide for:</p>
                    <ul style="margin-left: 6%">
                        <li>Easy and timely collection of accurate failure and maintenance data from the lab, field, and
                            supply chain in standardized and compatible data structures.
                        </li>
                        <li>Total elimination of complicated and redundant paper-based data records throughout the
                            failure collection process, thereby avoiding dual reporting.
                        </li>
                        <li>Effective data analysis to determine root cause mechanisms and real-time failure trends for
                            fast and accurate decision-making.
                        </li>
                        <li>Accurate historical reliability performance measures, such as mean time between failures
                            (MTBF), mean time to failure (MTTF), mean time to repair (MTTR), and availability for use in
                            determining appropriate corrective actions.
                        </li>
                        <li>Customizable reports that facilitate and support corrective action decisions by both
                            management and engineering personnel regarding the improvement of designs, manufacturing
                            processes, and field support systems.
                        </li>
                        <li>Optimized workflow management for timely dissemination, information accessibility, and rapid
                            feedback and approval cycles to fully support Collaborative Engineering, Six Sigma, and ISO
                            initiatives.
                        </li>
                        <li>Continued monitoring and testing to ensure that implemented corrective actions either
                            prevent failure recurrence or simplify or reduce maintenance tasks.
                        </li>
                        <li>Support of legacy systems and contribution to a common database for reliability,

                    <p>To provide such features to the various workgroup and enterprise levels that need them, a FRACAS
                        must be an aggressive closed-loop system that is configurable, flexible, and scaleable! This
                        means that all reported failures and faults must be entered in the FRACAS in an appropriate and
                        controlled manner so that they can then be analyzed and corrective actions identified,
                        implemented, and verified. The knowledge gained from this process must then be fed back into the
                        design, manufacturing, and test process so that quality and reliability are improved. A
                        simplified version of the closed-loop feedback path for a FRACAS follows.</p>
                    <p><span class="image right"><img src="../images/cache_889305735.png" alt=""></span>A FRACAS
                        formally captures predetermined types of data about a failure in an Incident Failure
                        Report (IFR). Completed IFRs are submitted to analysts so that they can identify the corrective
                        actions that are to be implemented to prevent these failures from recurring. Whenever corrective
                        actions are implemented and verified or are otherwise determined to be unnecessary, the IFR is
                        closed. To reduce the possibility of an unmanageable backlog of open IFRs, management
                        periodically reviews all unresolved IFRs to ensure their assignment and eventual closure.</p>
                    <p>A FRACAS can be used throughout the life cycle of any hardware or software product or system
                        process to track failures, incidents, issues, and even enhancements or suggestions. By
                        implementing a FRACAS during the initial design phase, significant cost savings can be realized
                        from early problem correction, when even major design changes can still be considered to
                        eliminate or reduce susceptibility to known failure causes. Additional benefits of implementing
                        corrective actions while performing in-house tests and inspections are the many opportunities
                        that exist for determining if these corrective actions adequately solve the reported issues.</p>
                    <p>If a FRACAS is not in place before product inspection or testing begins, problems often go
                        totally unrecorded or insufficient data is captured. If a FRACAS is not in place before the
                        product or process in put into production, it is unlikely that failure and maintenance data will
                        be collected in a structured and timely manner. Consequently, determining and implementing
                        effective corrective actions that either prevent failures from recurring or simplify maintenance
                        tasks will become very difficult.</p>

                        IFRs in the FRACAS should be properly trained to precisely capture the required data. To make
                        entering data in IFRs easy, the entry forms for capturing failure information should be tailored
                        to your hardware, software, or process. Once an IFR is created, the FRACAS should alert the
                        responsible analyst to its existence and indicate the next required action.</p>

                    <p>An analyst examines the information entered in an IFR to determine the root cause of the failure
                        and identify contributing factors. Methods for analyzing the root cause range from simple
                        investigations of circumstances surrounding a failure to sophisticated laboratory analyses of
                        failed parts. Once the analyst has established the root cause and contributing factors, he or
                        she must develop logically derived corrective actions. As the number of IFRs in the FRACAS
                        grows, the analyst can call upon the historic data for related or similar failures for help in
                        resolving what the appropriate corrective actions for a failure should be. Once corrective
                        actions are noted, the FRACAS should alert the technician who must perform them.</p>

                        indicate that the corrective actions taken have either eliminated the failure or reduced its
                        occurrence. Although verification is sometimes performed by the same or another technician,

                        events and problems for specified time periods, your FRACAS should be able to generate root
