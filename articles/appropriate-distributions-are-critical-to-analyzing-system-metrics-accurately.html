                    <h2>Failure and Repair Distribution</h2>
                    <p>The goal of system modeling is to provide quantitative forecasts of various system performance
                        measures such as downtime, availability, number of failures, capacity, and cost. Evaluation of
                        these measures is important to making optimal decisions when designing a system to either
                        minimize overall cost or maximize a system performance measure within the allowable budget and
                        other performance-based constraints.</p>
                    <p>When using software tools to model system design, several factors must be established in order to
                        accurately model the system. Two important factors taken into account in the analysis of a
                        system are the failure and repair behaviors of the system components. The failure and repair
                        rates of components are often defined in terms of distributions, or how the failures and repairs
                        occur during the time period the system is operational. Therefore, selecting the appropriate
                        distributions for these failure and repair times is critical to analyzing your system metrics
                        accurately. This article discusses the distribution types most commonly encountered in
                        real-world applications.</p>

                    <h2>General Overview </h2>
                    <p><span class="image right"><img src="../images/cache_890687523.jpg" alt=""></span>In general,
                        failure and repair times for systems and components are thought of as being random in
                        nature and therefore unpredictable. However, even though these times are random, they can be
                        modeled using statistical distribution techniques widely recognized in the mathematical
                        sciences.</p>
                    <p>A useful way to easily visualize the characteristics of a failure or repair distribution is
                        through the use of probability density functions (pdf). This article uses probability density
                        functions to describe different distributions.</p>
                    <p>Note: There are also other forms by which this same information can be characterized. These other
                        forms are the cumulative distribution function, or cdf, and the survival function (the
                        complement of cdf). These forms are not discussed in this article; however, if any one of the
                        above functions is known, all of the other functions associated with the distribution can be
                        easily obtained.</p>
                    <p>In general, the shape or type of failure distribution depends upon the component's failure
                        mechanisms. Similarly, the shape or type of repair distribution depends upon several factors
                        associated with component repairs. Several methods are used to determine the distribution that
                        best fits a given failure or repair pattern. Or, if failures or repairs are known to follow a
                        particular distribution, the specific parameters that define this pattern can be determined by
                        using the known failure and repair times.</p>
                    <p>If the type of distribution is not known in advance, then the distribution that best fits the
                        failure or repair times can be found using statistical methods. To find the best distribution
                        manually, probability plot papers are used. Alternatively, engineering software products can
                        also be used to generate probability plots and determine best-fit distributions. In general, it
                        is better to use available software tools because best-fit distributions are determined using
                        scientific analysis rather than human judgment, which must be used when manually creating
                        probability plots. Such engineering software products are commonly referred to as "Weibull"
                        analysis tools, simply because Weibull is a widely accepted, commonly used distribution for
                        describing failure and repair rates.</p>

                    <h2>Distributions</h2>
                    <p>As noted earlier, determining the failure and repair distributions of your system and its
                        components is a significant part of evaluating the reliability of your design. The next several
                        sections of this article describe the most commonly used distributions for modeling failure and
                        repair times. For your convenience, all of the required parameters for each of these
                        distributions are summarized in the table at the article's conclusion.</p>
                    <p>Distributions are referred to as single-parameter or two-parameter distributions. For
                        single-parameter distributions, only one variable is used to define the shape of the curve.
                        Two-parameter distributions require two variables to accurately model the distribution.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-12">
                    <h2>Exponential</h2>
                    <p>If the failure rate is constant, which is generally true for electronic components during the
                        main portion of their useful life, the reliability of the component follows an exponential
                        distribution. The exponential distribution is a single-parameter distribution, defined by using
                        failure/repair rate data. Exponential distributions have a wide range of applications in
                        analyzing the reliability and availability of electronic systems, various queuing networks, and
                        Markov chains.</p>
                    <p>Another consideration when assuming a constant failure rate is that component failure behavior is
                        regarded as memoryless. The memoryless property indicates that the remaining life of a component
                        is independent of its current age. This means that a used component is assumed to be as good as
                        a new component. The memoryless characteristic also assumes that the successful operation of a
                        component does not degrade the component. This memoryless property may not be applicable for all
                        types of components, particularly when there is wear and tear. Therefore, the assumption that
                        component lifetimes are described by an exponential distribution should be determined by
                        evaluating field data.</p>
                    <p>By manually plotting the failure rate from failure data, it can be determined if the failure rate
                        is almost constant, or whether it shows no pattern of change. In this case, the failure rate can
                        be assumed to follow the exponential distribution. For ease of plotting, probability plot papers
                        can be used. However, if a good Weibull analysis software tool is available, it can be used to
                        accurately and quickly analyze the failure data using scientific computational analysis.</p>

                    <p>The normal (or Gaussian) distribution is frequently used to describe equipment failure behavior
                        that has increasing failure rates with time. It is also commonly used to model strengths of
                        materials and the lifetimes of consumables. The normal distribution has a wide range of
                        applications in statistical inference, measurement errors, uncertainty analysis, and forecasting
                        errors.</p>
                    <p>The normal distribution is an important and widely used distribution in the field of statistics
                        and probability. It is the best known two-parameter distribution, defined by the mean (μ) and
                        standard deviation (σ). The mean is the expected value of the associated random variable. Using
                        failure or repair data, the mean of the distribution can be obtained by finding the average of
                        these values. In other words, for failure data, it is the sum of the failure times divided by
                        the total number of failures. The standard deviation is a measure of the deviation of the actual
                        values from the mean. In other words, it is the square root of the mean of the squared
                        deviations.</p>
                    <p>A normal distribution is symmetric about its mean. This means that the positive and negative
                        deviation occur with equal probability. This property is valid for several applications
                        involving random deviations. In reliability engineering, this property can be seen with
                        strengths of materials, percentages of defects in lots, and certain deterioration processes.
                        When μ = 0 and σ = 1, then it is referred to as the standard normal distribution.</p>
                    <p>To determine if failures are following a normal distribution, best-fit distribution analysis can
                        be quickly performed on field data using a good Weibull or failure data analysis software
                        product. If no such tool is available, failure data points can be manually checked to see
                        whether they follow the normal distribution. By plotting the pdf using the failure time data,
                        you can determine if the pdf is symmetric to its mean and also bell-shaped. If so, the failure
                        times follow the normal distribution. Another more systematic way of determining if failure
                        times are normally distributed is to plot the failure time data on probability plots of the
                        normal distribution. If the data points form a straight line, then the data follows a normal
                        distribution.</p>

                    <h2>Lognormal</h2>
                    <p><span class="image right"><img src="../images/cache_890687561.png" alt=""></span>Lognormal
                        distributions are encountered frequently in metal fatigue testing, maintainability data
                        (time to repair), chemical-process equipment failures and repairs, crack propagation, and
                        loading variables in probabilistic design. The lognormal distribution is similar to the normal
                        distribution except that the logarithms of the values of random variables-rather than the values
                        themselves-are assumed to be normally distributed. The two distribution parameters for the
                        lognormal distribution are the mean (µ) and standard deviation (s) of the underlying normal
                        distribution. </p>
                    <p>The lognormal distribution is found when the time to failure or repair results have cumulative
                        contributing factors. This property can be seen in several deterioration processes associated
                        with fatigue and creep mechanisms. The deterioration in such cases is generally progressive. For
                        example, a crack grows rapidly under high stress because the stress increases progressively as
                        the crack grows. In many situations, failure or repair times depend on several factors that are
                        random in nature. In such cases, the multiplication effect of these factors leads to a lognormal
                        failure or repair distribution.</p>
                    <p>To confirm that the failure or repair time data follows a lognormal distribution, the logarithms
                        of individual data points are first found and then the same techniques for verifying the normal
                        distribution can be used. However, the best verification method is to plot the failure or repair
                        time data on a lognormal probability plot and determine whether it follows a straight line. A
                        Weibull analysis software product that supports advanced scientific methods can quickly perform
                        these tests.</p>

                    <h2>Weibull</h2>
                    <p>Among all the distributions available for reliability calculations, the Weibull distribution is
                        the only one unique to the field. In his paper "A Distribution of Wide Applicability," Professor
                        Wallodi Weibull (1887-1979), who was studying metallurgical failures, pointed out that normal
                        distributions are not applicable for characterizing initial metallurgical strengths. He then
                        introduced a function that could embrace a great variety of distributions and used seven
                        different case studies to demonstrate how this function allowed the data to select the most
                        appropriate distribution from a broad family of Weibull distributions. Probably the most widely
                        used distribution in reliability engineering, the Weibull distribution can model failures cause
                        by fatigue, corrosion, mechanical abrasion, diffusion, and other degradation processes.</p>
                    <p>The two-parameter Weibull distribution requires characteristic life (η) and shape factor (β)
                        values. Beta determines the shape of the distribution. If beta is greater than 1, the failure
                        rate is increasing. If beta is less than 1, the failure rate is decreasing. If beta is equal to
                        1, the failure rate is constant. While there are several ways to check whether data follows a
                        Weibull distribution, the best choice is to use a Weibull analysis software product. If such a
                        tool is not available, data can be manually plotted on a Weibull probability plot to determine
                        if it follows a straight line. A straight line on the probability plot indicates that the data
                        is following a Weibull distribution.</p>

                        model inputs that must be considered. As an example, Table 1 compares the device parameters
