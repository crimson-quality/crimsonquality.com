        <h2>Reliability Prediction Models</h2>
        <p>Note: This is the second part of a three-part article. Part 1 identified the major factors in reliability
          prediction models that contribute to predicting component failure. This article, Part 2, describes the most
          widely accepted reliability prediction standards applied in current projects. Part 3 will provide guidelines
          for making a sound judgment when deciding which standard to apply to a particular analysis.</p>

            Reliability prediction model preferences vary greatly by industry and geographic location. In addition, the
            various models have unique characteristics that may or may not make that particular standard a better fit
            for your application. These characteristics include field or test data, confidence intervals and process
            grades, among others.
          </p>
          <p>The following paragraphs explore the most popular reliability standards, including MIL-HDBK-217, Telcordia,
            217Plus, NPRD/EPRD, and some lesser used models such as NSWC-98/LE1, PRISM, IEC62380, SN29500, HRD5, and
            GJB/z 299B.</p>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-12">
          <p>The earliest standard to appear was MIL-HDBK-217, <i>Military Reliability Prediction of Electronic
            Equipment</i>, developed by the United States Department of Defense (DOD) for their suppliers of military
            equipment. Because of its age, and due to the fact that it was developed from a customer’s point of view,
            MIL-HDBK-217 typically yields pessimistic results (i.e. higher predicted failure rate). There are several
            approaches to overcome its pessimistic results, the most recent of which is the ANSI/VITA 51.1-2008
            publication. Accepted and known worldwide, it is used by commercial companies and the defense industry.
            MIL-HDBK-217 models support the ability to perform parts count and parts stress predictions.</p>

        <div class="col-12">
          <p>The Telcordia standard, <i>Reliability Prediction Procedure for Electronic Equipment</i> (Technical
            Reference SR-322) was initially developed by AT&T Bell Lab, who modified MIL-HDBK-217 to better reflect
            failure rates that they were experiencing in the field. Like MIL-HDBK-217, these models include the ability
            to perform parts count or parts stress prediction. Telcordia also supports various calculation methods that
            allow the user to refine their predicted failure rate based on burn-in, laboratory, and/or field data. In
            addition, Telcordia supports user-definable confidence levels and calculation of a mean failure rate and
            standard deviation for each part. The most current version is Telcordia Issue 3, released in 2011.</p>

            <i>Handbook of 217Plus Reliability Prediction Models</i> is the basis for the 217Plus standard. It was
            published in 2006 by the Reliability Information Analysis Center (RiAC), a DoD Information Analysis Center.
            The successor to the PRISM standard, 217Plus supports all the major component categories found in
            MIL-HDBK-217. And like MIL-HDBK-217, 217Plus supports both parts count and parts stress predictions. This
            standard allows the user to incorporate experiences from similar equipment utilizing Bayesian analysis, and
            also accounts for “soft factors” related to the level of maturity of the supplier/manufacturer through the
            use of Process Grade factors.</p>

          <p>While NPRD and EPRD Libraries are not technically calculation models, they supply failure rates for

          <p>These databooks are electronic databases of failure rates published by the RIAC (Reliability Information
            Analysis Center). While reliability prediction standards like MIL-HDBK-217 contain mathematical models that
            are derived from empirical field failure data, these databooks contain historically observed field failure
            rates for commercial quality components and other part types not addressed by MIL-HDBK-217 that you can use
            for unsupported part types. NPRD 2011 contains failure rates for more than 80,000 types of components.</p>

            for process grades, application factors, and ruggedized factors to take non-component variables into
            account. The FIDES 2009 model can also adjust base failure rates by π factors for lead free factors. The

          <p>The PRISM model was released in March 2000. It deviates from traditional reliability prediction
            methodologies by allowing you to factor in component, assembly, and system test data. It also addresses
            system level design and manufacturing processes to refine the system prediction. The original PRISM model
            included only six models (resistors, capacitors, diodes, transistors, microcircuits and thyristors). In
            addition, component and system assessment models address not only operational aspects but also
            non-operational and/or dormant aspects of a part or system. PRISM has since been superseded by 217Plus.</p>

            Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). This standard has a complexity similar to Telcordia, but has its own
            dedicated component categories, and therefore is not compatible with the other standards. IEC TR 62380 uses
            cycling profiles and their applicable phases as a basis for failure rate calculations, and considers the
            effects of thermal cycling on the component failure rate.</p>

          <p>Windchill Prediction can use any of the standards described in this article to assess the reliability of
            your system design. Its superior integration enables you to mix calculation models within a single project,
            allowing you to select the model most appropriate to each part or component in your design. With Windchill
            Prediction, the additional analysis capabilities available in one model can typically be applied to any
            model you use. For example, Telcordia calculation methods for taking field and test data into account in the
            prediction can also be used with MIL-HDBK-217. Part 3 of this three-part article provides guidelines for
            making a sound judgment when deciding which reliability prediction standard to apply to a particular
            analysis. Additional information about Windchill Prediction, supported models, and predictive modeling in
